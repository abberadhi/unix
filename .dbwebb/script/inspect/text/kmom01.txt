I hope everything went well with the installation of Debian in VirtualBox. I have looked through your submission and all parts are in place and working as intended. Its good that you use variables in your Apache Virtual Host Config file, then if you would like to create more hosts, the procedure is very short.

The log file contains the correct commands and the screenshot shows that you can reach your server.

I have read your text and it is well written and reflective. All good so far so just keep going with the next assignment.

Remember that you can use the Discord channel for both help and feedback https://discord.com/invite/9K9zPJ9.
