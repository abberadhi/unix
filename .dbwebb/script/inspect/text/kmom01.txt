I hope the installation of VirtualBox went well and that you have a good environment for the Linux operating system. I have looked at your assignment and all parts are handed in. The log-file contains correct information and the screenshot shows that you can access the server.

I have also read your submitted text and it is well structured and reflecting. All is well this far. Continue with the next assignment.

Remember to use the Gitter channel for the course: https://gitter.im/dbwebb-se/unix.
