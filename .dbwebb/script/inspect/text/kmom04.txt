This was the final assignment! We created a larger Bash-script that works as a client for the maze-server.

We used commands such as "curl" to retrieve information and structured the code in proper functions.

I have looked at your solution and it solves the mazes in a good way.

Congratulations on a course well taken!

Soon you will be prompted to answer a short evaluation of the course. Please take a couple of minutes to answer it.
It helps us to improve the course and the material for future occasions. You will soon find the evaluation in Canvas.
